If you have admin permissions, you can add it to your own server using **[this link (click)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1213944670288347176&permissions=414464658496&scope=applications.commands%20bot)**. If not, you can contact a server mod/admin about it. I can't add the bot to individual servers, so don't contact me about it.
