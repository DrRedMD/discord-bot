# Welcome!

o/
This is the repo for the Discord bot HellCom StratDef Network, a Helldivers 2 community bot. This project is meant to be a utility/helper bot for any Helldivers Discords!

HellCom StratDef Network is the all-in-one solution for your Helldivers 2 server, delivering in-game updates right to your Discord! HellCom features live updates about the in-game war, easy and convenient ways to check in with the game's progress, and allows you to get notifications for any in-game event, so you can stay up to date on your fellow Helldivers' progress while you're offline!

HellCom will be continuously updated and improved. It is a community-driven project, so if there's a feature you'd like to see, feel free to suggest it in our Discord! Improvements and addition suggestions are always welcome =)

You can add it to your own server using **[this link (click)](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1213944670288347176&permissions=414464658496&scope=applications.commands%20bot)**.
